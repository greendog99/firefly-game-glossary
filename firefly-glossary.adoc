== Firefly Unofficial Glossary

[.normal]
This _Firefly: The Game_ Unofficial Glossary contains a unified set of
definitions from the Firefly base game and all expansions, organized
alphabetically by topic. This is not a teaching guide or rulebook—rather,
it is a reference to be used during play to assist with specific questions.

Phrases in *bold* refer to other relevant topics within the glossary.
Additional relevant topics which aren't mentioned in the main text are listed
at the end of the entry under "`Related Topics`".

_Italicized_ phrases indicate important details that should not be overlooked.

Some topics which apply only to expansions are noted with the expansion name in
blue:

* [.expansion]#BlueSun# — Blue Sun
* [.expansion]#Kalidasa# — Kalidasa
* [.expansion]#C&P# — Crime & Punishment
* [.expansion]#P&BH# — Pirates & Bounty Hunters

Expansion rules that conflict with core game rules are called out explicitly.
For example, [.expansion]#BlueSun# allows you to Mosey into a Reaver space,
whereas the base rules do not, as noted in the "`Fly Action`" topic.

=== Actions

Each turn, you may perform two _different_ actions. The four actions
you may choose from are *Buy*, *Deal*, *Fly*, and *Work*.

=== Alert Tokens

image::alert-tokens.png[float=right,pdfwidth=33%]

[.expansion]#BlueSun# [.expansion]#Kalidasa# Alert Tokens represent a higher
level of Reaver or Alliance activity within a sector. Multiple tokens of the
same or different type may coexist in the same sector. The three sectors of
Reaver Space contain a permanent Reaver Alert Token.

Each time a *Reaver Cutter* moves, place a Reaver Alert Token in the vacated
sector.

Alliance Alert Tokens are only placed by Story Cards, Setup Cards, or Nav
Cards.

If you move into a Sector containing Alert Tokens:

* Before drawing a *Nav Card*, roll a die. This die roll is not considered a Test
and cannot be modified.

* If the roll is less than or equal to the number of Alert Tokens, the player to
your right moves a ship to the sector as follows:

** image:alert-token-reaver.png[fit=line] _Reaver Token_ — Move any Reaver Cutter.

** image:alert-token-alliance.png[fit=line] _Alliance Token in Alliance Sector_ —  Move the Alliance Cruiser or the Operative's
Corvette.

** image:alert-token-alliance.png[fit=line] _Alliance Token in Border or Rim Sector_ — Move the Operative's Corvette.

* If needed, resolve the *Alliance Contact* or *Corvette Contact* tile for *Outlaw
Ships*. This may end your *Fly Action*, in which case do not draw a Nav Card if
you were Full Burning.

* Remove all Alert Tokens from the sector, regardless of the die roll.

If both Alliance and Reaver Tokens are present, resolve just the Alliance
Tokens first. If they are triggered, discard the Reaver Tokens, otherwise
proceed to resolve the Reaver Tokens.

=== Alliance Alert Cards

image::priority-alert.png[float=right,pdfwidth=33%]

[.expansion]#C&P# When an Alert Card is in play, there is a new special rule
that affects all the crews working the ‘Verse.

Some Set Up and Story Cards direct you to start the game with an Alert in Play.
There are also Misbehave Cards that direct you to put an Alert into play.

When an Alert Card leaves play, return it to the bottom of the Alert Deck.

=== Alliance Contact

Each time any Firefly encounters the *Alliance Cruiser*, immediately resolve
the Alliance Contact tile if that Firefly is an *Outlaw Ship*.

Once Alliance Contact has been resolved, it will not affect that Firefly again
while they remain together in the same sector.

=== Alliance Cruiser

The Alliance Cruiser moves in 3 different ways:

* When you draw the "`Alliance Cruiser`" Card, the Cruiser moves to your
Sector.

* When you draw the "`Alliance Entanglements`" card, you move the Alliance
Cruiser.

* When you draw the "`Cruiser Patrol`" card, the player to your right
moves the Cruiser one Sector within Alliance Space.

[.expansion]#P&BH#
Each time the "`Alliance Cruiser`" Nav Card is drawn, return the 3 face-up
*Bounty Cards* to the bottom of their deck and reveal 3 new ones.

*Related Topics:* Alliance Contact

=== Boarding Test

[.expansion]#P&BH# You may need to pass a Boarding Test when working a Piracy
Job or Bounty against a rival player's ship.

Perform a *Skill Test* using either your Techimage:skill-tech.png[fit=line] or
Negotiateimage:skill-negotiate.png[fit=line] skill for the Boarding Test. If
you succeed, proceed with your action. If you fail, the attempt is over and
your Work Action ends.

=== Bonus Opportunity

[.expansion]#Kalidasa# Some *Job Cards* include Bonus Opportunities. These are
_optional_ job tasks which can be completed after starting the Job, but before
completing the Job, for an additional reward. Use a Work Action to complete a
Bonus Opportunity.

When a bonus opportunity is completed, Place a Completed Token on the Job Card
and take the listed Bonus reward. You do _not_ have to pay your crew a cut of
the Bonus.

=== Botched

If *Working* a job results in "`Attempt Botched`", you've failed this attempt
at the job but may try it again in the future. Leave the Job Card in the Active
Jobs area and end your Work Action.

If a *Story Goal* attempt results in "`Attempt Botched`", you've failed this
attempt but may attempt the goal again next turn.

=== Bounty Cards

image::wanted-card.png[float=right,pdfwidth=33%]

[.expansion]#P&BH# Bounties are a special type of public Job requiring you to
apprehend a Fugitive, Bind them by Law, and deliver them to a drop-off
destination. Bounty Cards are typically associated with *Wanted* Crew.

Two *Work Actions* are needed to complete a Bounty Job—one to capture the
Fugitive, and one deliver them. To capture, you must be in the same Sector as
the fugitive. Then:

* If the Fugitive is in a rival’s Crew or is already Bound by Law on a Rival's
ship, you must pass a Boarding Test followed by a Showdown against the entire
rival Crew.

* If the Fugitive is in the discard pile of a Supply Planet, resolve a Showdown
between your Crew and the Fugitive. The player to your right rolls for the
defending Fugitive. The Fugitive uses their best available Skill.

* If the Fugitive is a member of your Crew you may betray them. The Fugitive is
apprehended without a Showdown. However, all members of your Crew except your
Leader become disgruntled.

The *Showdown* outcomes are shown on the Bounty Card. Once apprehended, take
the Fugitive's Crew Card and the Bounty Card. These are not part of your Crew
or Jobs, and do not count against your Crew or Job Limits or Cargo capacity (do
not take a Fugitive Token).

If you captured an _already Bound_ Fugitive from a Rival, you may choose to
deliver the Bounty yourself, or to Rescue the Fugitive by either adding them to
your Crew for free or returning them to their Supply Planet's discard pile. In
both cases, return the Bounty Card to the bottom of its deck.

If *Reaver Contact* kills your Fugitives, any captured Fugitives on your ship are
removed from the game.

When a Bounty is delivered, take your reward and pay your crew (or Disgruntle
them), as with any other Job. Then, remove the Bounty Card and Crew Card from
the game.

Each time the "`*Alliance Cruiser*`" Nav Card is drawn, return the 3 face-up
Bounties to the bottom of the Bounty Deck and reveal 3 new Bounties.

*Related Topics*: Cortex Alert

=== Bribes

Some Negotiateimage:skill-negotiate.png[fit=line] *Skill Tests* say "`Bribes`"
after their number. _Before_ you roll a die, you may choose to pay Bribes.

For every $100 you pay the bank, add +1 to your total. Your new test result
will be your Roll + Skill + Bribes.

=== Buy Action

The Buy Action may only be used at a *Supply Planet*. You may choose _one_ of
these two options:

* Purchase *Supply Cards*, Fuel (for $100 each), and Parts (for $300 each). When
buying Supply Cards, you may *Consider* 3 cards, and buy up to 2 of those cards.

* Send your entire Crew on Shore Leave: Pay $100 per Crew, whether
Disgruntled or not, including your Leader, and remove all Disgruntled tokens.

=== Cargo

Shipping Jobs require you to pick up legal Cargo at one location (using a *Work
Action*) and deliver it to a different location (using a second Work Action).

Once you are *Solid* with certain *Contacts*, you may sell excess Cargo to them
when *Dealing* with them. When you are Solid with Lord Harrow, you may purchase
Cargo from him.

Players in the same sector may *Trade* Cargo along with other items.

You may dump Cargo into space at any time on your turn to make more room in
your hold.

=== Challenge Cards

image::challenge-card.png[float=right,pdfwidth=33%]

[.expansion]#BlueSun# When *Dealing* with Mr. Universe, you *Consider* Big Damn
Challenges instead of Jobs. These count towards your 3-card hand limit.

When starting a new Job with a *Work Action*, you may attach a Challenge card to
the Job Card. Challenges may not be attached to Bounties or Piracy Jobs. Legal
and Illegal Challenges may only be attached to Jobs of the same legality.
Active Challenge Cards do not count toward your 3 Active Job limit.

Challenge Cards add extra requirements in order to complete the Job, but also
provide increased rewards.

If a Challenge Card requires extra *Misbehaves*, that number of Misbehaves must
be added at each step of the Job that already requires Misbehaving, or during
the final step if the job does not normally require Misbehaving.

When you complete a Job with an attached Challenge, you become Solid with Mr.
Universe in addition to the Job's Contact.

If you receive a *Warrant* while working a Job with an attached Challenge, you
lose Reputation with Mr Universe.

=== Consider

When *Buying* equipment or *Dealing* with Contacts, you may Consider 3 cards, and
may take up to 2 of those cards:

* Look through the discard pile for the Supply Planet or Contact and choose up to
3 cards to consider.
* For each card less than 3 that you pull from the discard pile, you may draw 1
card from the corresponding deck.
* Once you have picked your 3 cards to consider, you may take up to 2 of them,
paying if required.
* Any unaccepted cards are placed in the appropriate discard pile.

*Related Topics:* Buy Action, Deal Action

=== Contacts

Contacts have a variety of Jobs they’d like you to undertake. Signs on the map
mark Contact Planets where you can use the *Deal Action* to *Consider* new jobs
from the corresponding Contact Deck.

=== Contraband

Smuggling Jobs require you to pick up *Illegal* Contraband at one location (using
a *Work Action*), and deliver it to a different location (using a second Work
Action). These jobs require you to *Misbehave* when loading and/or unloading
Contraband.

Seized contraband can be difficult to replace. Replacements can occasionally be
found through *Nav Cards* or *Misbehave Cards*, or by *Trading* with other
players or when Solid with Fanty & Mingo.

You may dump Contraband into space at any time on your turn to make more room
in your hold.

=== Cortex Alert

[.expansion]#P&BH# A Cortex Alert is a special type of *Bounty Card* that pays
out on a whole class of Crew (e.g. Bandits) rather than a single named
Fugitive.

If you are the first player to successfully apprehend one of the targets, take
the Bounty Card as usual. You may attempt to apprehend additional targets on
future turns to add to the bounty stack if you wish. When you deliver the Bounty,
you receive the Bounty reward for each Bound Fugitive delivered.

You may steal a Cortex Alert Bounty from a rival player, following the same
Boarding Test and Showdown as when stealing a single Bound Fugitive. In this
case, you steal _all_ Bound Crew Cards with the Bounty Card, as part of a
single Work Action.

*Related Topics:* Bounty Cards

=== Corvette

[.expansion]#Kalidasa# See *Operative's Corvette*.

=== Corvette Contact

[.expansion]#Kalidasa# When the *Operative's Corvette* ends its movement in a
Sector with an *Outlaw Ship*, or an Outlaw Ship moves into the Corvette's
sector, immediately resolve the Corvette Contact tile.

=== Credits

Credits are used to buy *Gear*, Ship *Upgrades*, *Fuel* and *Parts*, to hire
*Crew* and pay them after completing a *Job*, and to offer *Bribes*.

Credits are usually gained by completing jobs, selling *Cargo* or *Contraband* to
*Solid* contacts, or in *Trade* with other players.

=== Crew Cards

Crew Cards can be found at *Supply Planets* along with Gear and Ship Upgrades,
and can be acquired with a *Buy Action* by paying the fee shown on the card.

Some Crew have professions—keywords which may help accomplish Jobs, Goals, or
other effects. Professions include: Soldier, Merc, Pilot, Mechanic, Companion,
Grifter, Medic, and Lawman.

=== Crime Jobs

Crime Jobs require you to travel to a destination and *Misbehave*.

*Related Topics:* Work Action

=== Cruiser

See *Alliance Cruiser*.

=== Cutter

See *Reaver Cutter*.

=== Deal Action

If your Firefly is in a *Contact’s* Sector, you may Deal with that Contact to
accept new jobs. If you are *Solid* with that Contact, you may also be able to
sell *Cargo* and *Contraband* to them or perform other actions as part of your Deal
Action.

When accepting new jobs, you may *Consider* 3 cards, and may accept up to 2 of
those cards.

You may not have more than 3 inactive Jobs or Challenges in your hand at any
time.

=== Disgruntled

image::disgruntled.png[float=right,pdfwidth=20%]

When a *Crew* becomes Disgruntled, place a Disgruntled Token on their card.

If a Disgruntled Crew receives a second Disgruntled Token, they jump
ship—return the Crew to the appropriate discard pile.

If your *Leader* ever receives a second Disgruntled token, they’ve lost
confidence in their Crew and fire them. Discard all your Crew, except for your
Leader, to their Supply Deck discard piles. Remove the Disgruntled token from
your Leader.

You may, on your turn, hire Disgruntled Crew away from another player in your
Sector by paying the Crew's hiring fee to the bank. Take the Crew Card and
remove the Disgruntled token.

You may remove Disgruntled Tokens by sending your Crew on Shore Leave during a
*Buy Action*.

*Related Topics:* Immoral Jobs

=== Dismissing Crew

You may dismiss Crew in any *Planetary Sector* by placing them in the discard
pile of the card’s Supply Deck. This does not require an Action. You may not
dismiss Crew to prevent them from being Killed. You may not dismiss your
Leader.

=== Drive Core

Each Drive Core has a maximum range, which is the number of sectors it can move
its ship during a Full Burn. Drive Cores may also have additional special
rules listed on their cards.

You may only have one Drive Core at a time. If you get a new Drive Core,
Discard your previous one.

*Related Topics:* Fly Action

=== Evade

When a *Nav Card* result says to Evade, move your ship to an adjacent sector. Do
not draw an additional Nav Card. No further movement is possible. If you have
another Action to take, you may do so.

You may never Evade into a sector that is occupied by a Reaver Cutter.

=== Fly Action

When Flying, you may choose _one_ of these two options:

* _Full Burn_ — spend one *Fuel* and move up to the range of your ship's *Drive
Core*. For each sector entered, draw and resolve a *Nav Card* for the new region
before continuing.

* _Mosey_ — move one sector and your Fly action ends. Do not spend Fuel or draw a
Nav Card.

You may never move diagonally between sectors.

When a sector is occupied by a *Reaver Cutter*, no ship may Full Burn or
*Evade* into that sector, but may Mosey in if playing with [.expansion]#BlueSun#.

=== Fuel

Fuel is needed in order to Full Burn during the *Fly Action*. Fuel can be
purchased at any *Supply Planet* as part of a *Buy Action*. You may dump Fuel
at any time on your turn to make space in your hold.

=== Full Burn

See *Fly Action*.

=== Full Stop

If a card instructs you to "`Full Stop`", your ship stops in its current
Sector. No further movement is possible. If you have another Action to take,
you may do so.

=== Fugitives

Transport Jobs require you to pick up *Passengers* or Fugitives at one location
(using a *Work Action*), and deliver them to a different location (using a second
Work Action). Transporting Fugitives is *Illegal* and makes you an *Outlaw Ship*.

You may drop Fugitives off in any sector with a Planet at any time on your turn
to make space in your hold.

=== Gear Cards

Gear is weapons, equipment, clothing, vehicles or anything else your *Crew* might
carry to help overcome obstacles.

Each member of your Crew may only equip one piece of Gear at any given time. If
you own more Gear than can be carried by your Crew, leave the extra Gear on
your ship until it’s needed. Gear not carried by a Crew may not be used in any
way.

Gear may be re-arranged between Crew and/or your Ship at any time except during
a *Work Action*.

Some Gear provides additional Skill Points, *Keywords* or other special
abilities.

=== Goal Token

See *Story Goals*.

=== Goods

Goods are *Cargo*, *Contraband*, *Fuel* and *Parts*. If a card allows you to
load a number of Goods, you may choose which type of Goods you’d like to load,
and may mix different Goods.

=== Havens

[.expansion]#BlueSun# Some Story Cards will direct you to Choose Havens during
Set Up. Each Story Card will detail the Havens’ importance and which planets
may or may not be eligible for selection.

During Set Up, after choosing Leaders, players place their Haven tokens instead
of placing their ships. Haven Tokens must be placed in Sectors containing
planets but may not be placed at Supply or Contact planets. Players may not
place their Haven Token in a Sector that is already another player’s Haven.
Unless otherwise noted, players’ ships start at their Haven.

[%breakable]
=== Heavy Load

image::heavy-load.png[float=right,pdfwidth=20%]

Some Jobs require transporting Heavy Loads. These requiring spending one extra
*Fuel* during a Full Burn in order to heavy burn.

The effect of multiple Heavy Load tokens is cumulative.

If your *Drive Core* doesn't require Fuel to Full Burn, you must still pay the
Heavy Load penalty.

=== Immoral Jobs

See *Morality*.

=== Job Cards

image::needs.png[float=right,pdfwidth=20%]

You may not have more than 3 Job cards in your hand at any given time. You may
discard any Job you don’t want to undertake.

Job Cards contain the Job Type (shipping, transport, smuggling, or crime),
location(s) where the job is to be performed, whether the job is *Immoral* or
not, if *Misbehaving* is required, *Skills* and *Keywords* needed to Work the
job, the job's payout, and more.

*Related Topics:* Bonus Opportunity, Work Action

=== Keep Flying

When a *Nav Card* outcome says to Keep Flying, you may continue your *Fly
Action* if you still have range left on your *Drive Core*.

=== Keywords

Many *Gear Cards* and some *Crew* have green Keywords on their cards. These
include: [.keyword]#FIREARM#, [.keyword]#SNIPER RIFLE#, [.keyword]#EXPLOSIVES#,
[.keyword]#HACKING RIG#, [.keyword]#FAKE ID#, [.keyword]#TRANSPORT#, and
[.keyword]#FANCY DUDS#.

Keywords sometimes allow you to bypass a *Misbehave Card* entirely or may be
a prerequisite for some Misbehave options or Job Cards.

=== Killed

Whenever a test result says to Kill some number of *Crew*, you must choose Crew
to be removed from the game. If you choose your *Leader*, place a *Disgruntled*
Token on your Leader and return your Leader to the ship for the rest of the
*Work Action* instead of removing the Leader's Crew Card from the game.

The *Medic* profession grants a chance to save the Crew and return them to the
ship for the remainder of the turn.

=== Kosherized rules

Some Fight *Skill Tests* will say "`Kosherized`" after the skill point number.
In Kosherized fights, you may not add any Fight
Skillimage:skill-fight.png[fit=line] from *Gear* to your total: only the
image:skill-fight.png[fit=line] listed on your *Crew Cards* may be used.

=== Lawman

[.expansion]#P&BH# Some Crew have the profession of Lawman. These Crew are free
to hire and are not paid a cut from Jobs.

Lawmen will never work an *Illegal* Job—they will remain onboard your ship
instead.

Each Lawman pays a Bounty Bonus when a Bound Fugitive is successfully delivered
to the drop-off location on a *Bounty Card*.

=== Leaders

Your Leader always counts as Crew, taking up one Crew space on your Ship Card,
costing $100 during Shore Leave, etc.

When the outcome of any event would cause your Leader to be *Killed*, return
them to your ship for the rest of the *Work Action* and place a *Disgruntled*
Token on the card instead. *Medics* can attempt to save a Leader before this
happens.

If your Leader ever receives a second Disgruntled token, they’ve lost
confidence in their Crew and fire them. Discard all your Crew, except for your
Leader, to their Supply Deck discard piles. Remove the Disgruntled token from
your Leader.

Leaders can never be hired away by other players.

=== Make-Work

If you have nothing to do and your ship is in a *Planetary Sector*, you may use
your entire *Work Action* to take $200 from the bank instead of Working a Job.

=== Medic

If you have a Medic in your Crew, make a Medic Check whenever a Crew is
*Killed*:

* 1–4: Crew Dies, remove from play.
* 5–6: Crew is returned to the ship.

Some Gear and Ship Upgrades can modify the Medic Check.

Medics may make a Medic check even if they are the ones at risk of being
Killed. They may also prevent a *Leader* from being *Disgruntled* when the
Leader would normally be Killed.

[%breakable]
=== Misbehave Cards

image::misbehave-card.png[float=right,pdfwidth=20%]

To complete some Jobs or Story Goals, you must proceed through the number of
Misbehave Cards pictured on the Job Card. Draw cards one at a time and attempt
each before proceeding to the next. Once you start the job attempt, you must
see it through and cannot stop early.

Most Misbehave Cards have two options you can choose from. Some options may
have requirements such as *Keywords*. Some cards my have two steps to pass
sequentially.

The bottom of some Misbehave Cards list a Person, Profession, Item, or
*Keyword* which will allow you to proceed automatically without misbehaving.

Misbehaving outcomes:

* _Proceed_ — continue to work the job.
* _Attempt Botched_ — you've failed this attempt but may attempt the job again in
the future. Leave the Job Card in the Active Jobs area and end your Work
Action.
* _Warrant Issued_ — you've failed the job and attracted the authorities. Place a
*Warrant* Token on your Ship Card. Discard the job to its Contact Deck and end
your Work Action.

=== Morality

Some Jobs are Immoral and some are Morally Subjective. A small red tab on the
*Job Card* below the Legal/Illegal tab notes the Job's morality. If nothing is
listed, the job is Moral.

Whenever you complete an Immoral Job, all your Moral Crew become *Disgruntled*.

[.expansion]#P&BH# Working on a Subjectively Moral job against a rival ship
with a Moral Leader makes the job Immoral: your Moral Crew do not like to
target other Moral Leaders.

=== Mosey

See *Fly Action*.

=== Nav Cards

Nav Cards describe obstacles and encounters in the 'Verse. When using the *Fly
Action*, draw and resolve a Nav Card matching each sector entered (Alliance
Space, Border Space, or Rim Space), before continuing to the next sector.

When any Nav Deck becomes exhausted, or when a card marked "RESHUFFLE" is
resolved, reshuffle the discard pile and remaining deck to form a new deck.

=== Operative's Corvette

[.expansion]#Kalidasa# The Operative prowls all of known space, looking for
fugitives and wanted criminals. His Corvette may enter any sector on the map.

If the Operative’s Corvette is ever in the same Sector as a *Reaver Cutter*, the
Reavers are driven off. Move the Reaver ship to a Reaver Starting Sector.

The Operative’s Corvette may not end its move in the three Reaver Starting Sectors.

Whenever the Operative’s Corvette enters a Sector with any Reaver *Alert
Tokens* image:alert-token-reaver.png[fit=line] , remove the tokens without
resolving them.

*Related Topics:* Corvette Contact

=== Outlaw Ship

A ship is considered an Outlaw Ship if it has any outstanding *Warrants*, is
carrying *Contraband* or *Fugitives* (even in the ship's Stash), or has any *Wanted
Crew* onboard.

=== Parts

Spare Parts are sometimes needed in order to make repairs while flying through
the 'Verse. Parts can be purchased at a *Supply Planet* as part of a *Buy action*,
or sometimes can be found through *Nav Cards* or other means.

You may dump Parts at any time on your turn to make space in your hold.

=== Passengers

Transport Jobs require you to pick up Passengers or *Fugitives* at one location
(using a *Work Action*), and deliver them to a different location (using a
second Work Action).

You may drop Passengers off in any sector with a Planet at any time on your
turn to make space in your hold.

=== Piracy Jobs

[.expansion]#P&BH# Piracy Job Cards allow you to raid rival players' ships,
making off with stolen goods: cargo, contraband, fuel and parts.

Like any other job, a *Work Action* is used to Work a Piracy Job. Your ship must
be in the same sector as your intended target. You must first pass a *Boarding
Test* followed by a *Showdown*.

=== Planetary Sector

A Planetary Sector is any sector that contains a named planet. The Space Bazaar
and Cortex Relay 7 count as planets.

*Related Items:* Uroboros Belt

=== Reaver Contact

Resolve the Reaver Contact tile when starting your turn in a *Reaver Cutter's*
sector. The tile offers two options, one of which requires a Pilot, Mechanic,
and Fuel.

=== Reaver Cutters

If you start your turn in the same Sector as a Reaver Cutter, resolve the
*Reaver Contact* tile.

When a Sector is occupied by a Reaver Cutter, no ship may Full Burn or Evade
into that Sector, but may Mosey in if playing with [.expansion]#BlueSun#.

The Reaver Cutters can move in 3 different ways:

* When you draw the "`Reaver Cutter`" card, the Cutter moves to your Sector.

* When you draw the "`Reaver Bait`" card, you move the Cutter.

* When you draw the "`Reavers on the Hunt`" card, the player to your right
moves the Cutter one Sector within Border Space.

Only one Reaver ship may ever be in a sector. If a Nav Card would call a second
Cutter to a sector, instead immediately resolve Reaver Contact instead.

If the Operative’s Corvette is ever in the same Sector as a Reaver Cutter, the
Reavers are driven off. Move the Reaver ship to a Reaver Starting Sector.

[.expansion]#BlueSun# Each time a Reaver Cutter moves, place a Reaver *Alert
Token* in the vacated sector.

=== Reputation

See *Solid*.

=== Salvage Op

Some cards have "`Salvage Op`" listed on them. This may activate a bonus on
certain Crew Cards.

=== Seizure

[.expansion]#C&P# Some *Misbehave Cards* call for Seizing a type of equipment.
If your crew has any of their gear Seized, it is removed from the game and may
not be repurchased.

=== Set Up Cards

Set Up Cards allow different ways to set up a game of Firefly (starting Jobs,
Gear, map setup, etc.) Story Cards may override some Set Up Card steps.

=== Ship Card

Your Ship Card has a hold and a *Stash* that are used to store and hide goods,
slots for a *Drive Core* and *Ship Upgrades*, and a maximum crew capacity.

=== Ship Upgrade Cards

Ship Upgrades allow you to customize your ship, and can be purchased at *Supply
Planets*. Each Ship Card has a number of upgrade slots available. You may never
have more Ship Upgrades than Ship Card upgrade slots. You may discard a Ship
Upgrade at any time.

=== Shore Leave

See *Buy Action*.

=== Showdown

[.expansion]#P&BH# In a showdown, the active player is the Attacker and the
target player is the Defender. The Attacker must first choose which Skill they
will use in the Showdown. The Defender then chooses which Skill they will
defend with.

Both players may allocate their Gear to any Crew they wish before the Showdown
roll.

Both players roll a die and add it to their chosen Skill. The higher total wins
the Showdown. The Defender wins ties.

=== Skill Test

There are three types of skills: Fightimage:skill-fight.png[fit=line],
Techimage:skill-tech.png[fit=line] and
Negotiateimage:skill-negotiate.png[fit=line]. You can find skill points on both
*Crew* and *Gear* Cards. Each symbol shown on a Crew or Gear Card counts as 1
skill point when performing Skill Tests.

image::skill-test.png[float=right,pdfwidth=50%]

Skill Tests are written as a Skill icon, followed by a small die and a target
number. Roll a die and add all your available Skill Points of the appropriate
type. Then, compare your total to the list of possible results under the target
number.

Whenever you roll a Firefly on the die, count it as a 6 and make a *Thrillin'
Heroics Bonus Roll*—roll the die again and add the result to the total.

=== Solid

When you complete a *Job* for a *Contact* your reputation with them becomes
Solid. Slide the completed Job Card under your Ship Card so the name of the
Contact is visible. If you complete a job and are already Solid with that
Contact, remove the newly completed job card from the game.

When you are Solid, Contacts will buy Cargo and Contraband from you when
dealing with them, and can offer other benefits.

If you receive a *Warrant* while working a Job for a Contact, any reputation
with that Contact is lost along with any and all benefits for being Solid.
Remove from the game the completed Job Card used to track your Solid reputation
with the contact. You may prove yourself useful again by completing another Job
for the offended Contact and restore your Solid rep.

Receiving a Warrant for _any reason_ will cause reputation loss with Harken,
regardless of what contact the Job you were working came from. You may not
become Solid with Harken while you have a Warrant.

=== Splitting Up

[.expansion]#C&P# Some *Misbehave Cards* require your Crew to split into two
teams. You must have at least one Crew in each team. If you only have one Crew
member left working the Job when called upon to Split your Crew, you’ve *Botched*
the Job Attempt.

=== Stash

Your ship's Stash storage provides some protection against searches and piracy.
When targeted by a Piracy Job, you may re-arrange your Goods, Passengers
and Fugitives between your Cargo Hold and Stash.

The Stash on Jetwash and Esmeralda may only hold Fuel.

=== Story Cards

Each game of Firefly starts with choosing a Story Card. Story Cards detail what
each player needs to accomplish to win the game.

If the Story Card has numbered *Story Goals* you must complete these goals in
order. In other cases, there may only be a single goal needed to win.

=== Story Goals

If a Story Goal calls for a *Skill Test*, you must use a *Work Action* to
advance the Goal; otherwise, the Goal is simply achieved when you meet its
requirements.

When you complete a Goal, take a Goal token to mark your progress. Once a Goal
is achieved, it cannot be lost. Goals are not Jobs, thus you do not pay your
Crew after working a Goal, and any abilities or cards which reference a "`Job`"
do not apply.

If a Story Goal results in "`Attempt *Botched*`", you've failed this attempt but
may attempt the goal again next turn.

If a Story Goal results in "`*Warrant* Issued`", you've failed the goal and
attracted the authorities but may attempt the goal again next turn. Place a
Warrant Token on your Ship Card.

=== Supply Planets

Supply Planets offer *Crew* for hire, *Gear* for your crew to carry and *Ship
Upgrades*. Signs on the map mark Supply Planets where you can use the *Buy Action*
to hire and acquire these cards.

=== "`Thrillin’ Heroics`" Bonus Roll

The dice in the game have a Firefly pictured instead of a 6. Whenever you roll
a Firefly, count it as a 6 and make a Bonus Roll: roll the die again and add
the result to the total.

=== Trading

When two or more players’ ships are _stopped_ in the same sector, they may
buy, sell and trade *Crew*, *Fuel*, *Parts*, *Cargo*, *Contraband*, Ship
*Upgrades* and *Gear* to one another without restriction. They may not exchange
Jobs, Passengers, Fugitives or Drive Cores.

Players are free to discuss and make these deals outside of the normal turn
order and other players may take their normal turn while bargains are struck.
Dealing with others players in this fashion does not require using an Action.
The opportunity for Trading ends when one of the players leaves the sector.

[.expansion]#BlueSun# Credits may be exchanged with another player at any time,
regardless of location.

=== Upgrades

See *Ship Upgrades*.

=== Uroboros Belt

The Uroboros Belt is an area of space around the Blue Sun star that is littered
with mineral-rich asteroids and planetoids.

You can start working a Job in the Uroboros Belt in any of the 4 Sectors that
picture Uroboros asteroids.

Uroboros Sectors are not considered *Planetary Sectors* unless they also contain
a named planet.

=== Wanted Crew

*Crew* members with a small warrant badge next to their cost are wanted by the
Alliance. If you have Wanted Crew onboard you are an *Outlaw Ship* and when you
encounter the *Alliance Cruiser*, the Crew may be seized.

=== Wanted Crew Tokens

image::wanted-token.png[float=right,pdfwidth=25%]

[.expansion]#C&P# When a result states "`Your Crew is now Wanted`", add a Wanted
token to each of your Crew who isn’t already Wanted. They now count as Wanted
whenever you’re called upon to make a Wanted Crew Roll.

If a Crew with a Wanted Token is dismissed, discard the Wanted Token.

=== Warrant

If you receive a Warrant while *Working* a *Job*, discard the Job, returning it
to the discard pile of the issuing Contact. Any *Solid* Reputation with that
Contact is lost.

Receiving a Warrant for _any reason_ will cause reputation loss with Harken,
regardless of what contact the Job you were working came from. You may not
become Solid with Harken while you have a Warrant.

=== Work Action

Taking a Work Action allows you to attempt to move a single Job forward.
Succeeding at a Crime job completes the job, while delivery jobs require two
successful Work Actions at different locations—one to start the job and one to
complete it.

To work on a job:

* Your Firefly must be in the specified location for the current Job step.
* Confirm that the job's "`Needs`" are met. Usually this requires *Skills* or
*Keywords*. "`Needs`" must be met during both the pick-up and drop-off stages of
Delivery jobs.
* Place the Job Card face-up in your Active Jobs area, if not already started.
You may never have more than three active Jobs.
* Select which *Crew* will participate and assign gear to them as desired. Crew and
gear left on the ship may not be used during the attempt.
* Follow the instructions on the Job Card to attempt to work the job.

If, while working a Job, all your Crew is killed or returns to the ship, you’ve
*Botched* the Job.

After successfully completing a job:

* Take the indicated payout from the bank, including any bonuses from the Job
Card, Crew Cards, and Story Card.
* Pay every crew member their fee, whether they worked on the job or not. Any
Crew member you choose not to pay becomes *Disgruntled*.

* To show you are *Solid* with a Contact, take the completed Job Card and slide
it under your Ship Card so the name of the Contact is visible. If you were
already Solid, remove the Job Card from the game.

If you have nothing to do and your ship is in a *Planetary Sector*, you may
instead use your entire Work Action to *Make-Work* at the planet: take $200
from the bank instead of Working a Job.

_Note:_ if you’ve Loaded Cargo, Contraband, Passengers or Fugitives on to your
ship as part of a Job and subsequently lose them, you’re on your own to replace
them. You can’t return to the Pick Up location to get more.
