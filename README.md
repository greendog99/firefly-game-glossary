## Style Guide

The following guidelines are preferred, though exceptions occur.

* Use a second-person point of view. For example,
"`If you roll a 6`" rather than "`If the player rolls a 6`"

* Spell out single digit numbers (i.e. "one" rather than "1") unless
the number is referencing a die roll.
