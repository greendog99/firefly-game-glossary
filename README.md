# Firefly: The Game
## Unofficial Glossary

This "Firefly: The Game" unofficial glossary contains a unified set of
definitions from the Firefly base game and all expansions, organized
alphabetically by topic. This is not a teaching guide or rulebook... it is a
reference to be used during play to assist with specific questions.

Feedback is welcomed! Please let me know about any errors, typos, omissions,
formatting mistakes, or general suggestions. I created this by browsing all the
rulebooks, FAQ, and various other guides that have been uploaded.

## Style Guide

The following guidelines are preferred, though exceptions occur.

* Use a second-person point of view. For example,
"`If you roll a 6`" rather than "`If the player rolls a 6`"

* Spell out single digit numbers (i.e. "one" rather than "1") unless
the number is referencing a die roll.

* It's OK to repeat information in multiple places if that will help players
find their answer more quickly (e.g. "no ship may Full Burn or Evade into a
Reaver Cutter's sector" is mentioned in both the "Fly Action" and "Reaver
Cutter" sections.)
